Hiring the right dental assistant is crucial for a smoothly run practice. In British Columbia, **Dental Assistants** generally fall into two categories: **Certified Dental Assistants (CDAs)** and **‚ÄúChairside‚Äù Dental Assistants** (uncertified). While their titles sound similar, their training, legal scope of practice, and roles in your office are very different. This article compares chairside and certified dental assistants in BC ‚Äì helping dentists and office managers understand each role and make informed staffing decisions.

## Understanding the Two Roles

According to the [BC Dental Association](https://www.bcdental.org/) and [WorkBC](https://www.workbc.ca/career-profiles/dental-assistants), there are **two levels of dental assisting in BC**:

- **Certified Dental Assistants (CDAs)** ‚Äì CDAs complete a formal diploma/certificate program at an accredited college and **must be certified by the [BC College of Oral Health Professionals (BCCOHP)](https://oralhealthbc.ca/)**. They are trained to assist the dentist during patient treatment and are **qualified to perform certain procedures on patients under the dentist‚Äôs direction**. In other words, CDAs can carry out some hands-on **intra-oral tasks** in the patient‚Äôs mouth (beyond just passing instruments).

- **Chairside Dental Assistants (Uncertified)** ‚Äì Often simply called ‚Äúdental assistants,‚Äù these individuals typically **do not require formal training** ‚Äì they learn on the job, trained by the dentist. A chairside assistant‚Äôs duties are **limited to extra-oral support**. Unlike a CDA, a non-certified assistant **cannot perform any procedures inside the patient‚Äôs mouth**. Their role is restricted to helping the dentist **outside** the oral cavity (e.g. preparing instruments, charting, sterilization, and patient management), rather than independently doing clinical tasks on the patient.

In short, **only a Certified Dental Assistant may perform ‚Äúintra-oral‚Äù duties in BC, whereas an uncertified chairside assistant is limited to ‚Äúextra-oral‚Äù duties**. This fundamental difference is defined by provincial regulations for health professionals and directly impacts what each type of assistant can do in your practice.

## Training and Certification Requirements

The pathway to becoming a CDA is much more rigorous than for a chairside assistant:

- **Education** ‚Äì CDAs must graduate from an **accredited Level II dental assisting program** (typically 10‚Äì12 months long) at a recognized college. Programs include both Level I (chairside basics) and Level II (intra-oral skills) training. By contrast, a person can become a chairside dental assistant **with no formal schooling**, often starting with just a high school diploma and receiving on-the-job training.

- **National Exam (NDAEB)** ‚Äì After completing an accredited program, aspiring CDAs in BC are required to pass the [National Dental Assisting Examining Board (NDAEB)](https://www.ndaeb.ca/) written examination. **Holding the NDAEB certificate is mandatory** for new dental assisting graduates to become licensed/certified in almost all Canadian provinces, including British Columbia. This ensures they have met a national standard of competency. *Uncertified chairside assistants are not eligible to take the NDAEB exam* because they have not completed an accredited Level II program.

- **Provincial Certification (Licensure)** ‚Äì Upon passing the NDAEB exam, the graduate can apply to register with the [BCCOHP](https://oralhealthbc.ca/) as a Certified Dental Assistant. BCCOHP is the regulatory body that governs CDAs (as well as dentists, hygienists, technicians, etc.) under BC law. Only those registered with BCCOHP may use the title ‚ÄúCertified Dental Assistant (CDA)‚Äù in BC and perform the full scope of CDA duties.

- **Training Programs** ‚Äì Some institutions offer shorter **Chairside Dental Assisting courses** aimed at providing basic skills for on-the-job support. For example, [Ascentia Career Institute‚Äôs Chairside Dental Assistant Program](https://www.ascentiacareerinstitute.com/chairside-dental-assistant) is a 6-month program focusing on foundational knowledge and practical experience. **However, completion of a chairside program does *not* qualify graduates for BCCOHP certification as a CDA** nor to write the NDAEB exam. It‚Äôs meant to prepare students for entry-level assisting roles only. 

**Bottom line:** To become a Certified Dental Assistant in BC, an individual must complete accredited Level I & II training *and* pass the NDAEB exam to register with BCCOHP. A chairside assistant does not meet these requirements and thus cannot perform the expanded duties reserved for certified professionals.

## Scope of Practice and Duties

Because of their differing training and regulatory status, CDAs and chairside assistants have distinct scopes of practice. Understanding what tasks each can (and cannot) do is essential for proper staff utilization and compliance with regulations.

### What a Certified Dental Assistant Can Do

CDAs are equipped with an expanded skillset that allows them to perform a variety of intra-oral and clinical functions under the supervision of a dentist:

- **Taking and developing dental X-rays**
- **Polishing teeth and clinical crowns**
- **Applying fluoride treatments and sealants**
- **Taking preliminary impressions**
- **Placing and removing dental dams, matrix bands, liners**
- **Providing oral hygiene instruction**
- **Assisting in restorative and specialty procedures**

The [BCCOHP](https://oralhealthbc.ca/) outlines these duties as part of the CDA‚Äôs regulated scope. CDAs do not diagnose or drill, but by handling many intra-oral procedures, they allow dentists to focus on complex work. All clinical tasks are performed under dentist supervision.

### What a Chairside Dental Assistant Can Do

Chairside assistants focus exclusively on **non-invasive extra-oral duties**, such as:

- Preparing and cleaning treatment rooms
- Sterilizing instruments
- Seating patients and assisting during procedures (extra-orally)
- Updating records and charting
- Scheduling and administrative support
- Explaining post-op instructions (non-clinical)

The [WorkBC profile on dental assistants](https://www.workbc.ca/career-profiles/dental-assistants) and BCCOHP guidance confirm that **chairside assistants cannot perform procedures inside the patient‚Äôs mouth**. They are supportive team members who help the clinic function smoothly but are **not licensed for clinical care**.

### Legal Boundaries on Duties

These differences are not just guidelines ‚Äì they are backed by law. BC‚Äôs health professions regulations define certain **‚Äúrestricted activities‚Äù** which may only be delegated to certified professionals. Examples include:

- Taking radiographs
- Applying fluoride or sealants
- Performing polishing
- Taking impressions

The [Dentists Regulation](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/226_2009#section4) under the Health Professions Act identifies these restricted tasks. Dentists are **not permitted** to assign them to uncertified team members.

## Staffing Smart: How Both Roles Add Value

Both CDAs and chairside assistants play vital roles in the dental office.

**CDAs** bring high-level clinical support:
- Legally perform expanded duties
- Enhance patient care
- Allow for efficient delegation
- Are regulated, licensed professionals

**Chairside Assistants** offer operational support:
- Handle sterilization, prep, admin
- Help CDAs and dentists stay focused
- Improve front-desk and backroom flow
- Are quicker to onboard and more flexible in some roles

Having both can help your practice run efficiently, stay compliant, and reduce staff burnout. They complement each other, especially in high-volume or short-staffed settings.

## Final Thoughts and Call to Action

**Certified Dental Assistants and Chairside Dental Assistants play distinct but complementary roles** in your practice. Understanding their scopes and requirements helps you staff strategically and legally.
